            <h2>1. Where will the ceremony and reception be held?</h2>
            <p>Our wedding will be held at Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Arnold, CA. 
            Our Ceremony will be located at the Standing Centennial Tree, the reception will 
            be followed in the Jack Knight Hall.</p>
 
            <h2>2. Can I bring a plus one?</h2>
            <p>We are not allowing additional plus-ones to our wedding, as there is a max 
            capacity at our reception hall. The bride or groom will have let you know if 
            you are able to bring a plus one.</p>

            <h2>3. Should I bring a gift?</h2>
            <p>As we prepare to embark on our new journey together, your presence at 
            our wedding is the greatest gift we could ask for. However, if you 
            would like to contribute to our special day, we have created a honeymoon 
            fund instead of registering for traditional gifts, which can be found on 
            our wedding website. Your donation will help make our honeymoon 
            unforgettable and create memories that will last a lifetime. However, if 
            you would like to bring a physical gift we have provided a small registry. 
            We have provided a link to our honeymoon fund on our website!</p>
